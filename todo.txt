move movedefs to a dictionary/list
(streamline the process)
(i.e. avoid calling moves() in do_move())

unit tests for some moves/move combinations

make it clearer which mode the code is meant for
(e.g. perform_move is only correct in w-notation.)
(fix ambiguities / names and functions that implicitly use w-notation)


---KNOWN?-BUGS?---

1. (FIXED) _nf_suppress_warnings is not defined (i.e. if a non-list is given to moves() an error will be raised)

---END-OF-KNOWN-BUGS---


lower priority:
slice moves?
